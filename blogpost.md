'To conquer self is the first and noblest of all victories.' - Plato

I’m pretty sure that Plato didn’t have programming’s keyword of “self” in mind when he spoke of victories, but learning how to use “self” in multiple levels of scope is nothing short of victorious. The abstraction that is involved in object oriented programming, reminds me of how much I enjoyed algebra during my secondary school years.

On the same note of finding joy in programming, I have to admit that object architecture is so fun!

At this point in my Flatiron journey, I’ve learned that I enjoy the process of creating from scratch as much as I enjoy delving into an existing code product and improving it!

I also learned that there is much more to consider and many more decisions to be made as a programmer than I originally realized. From naming classes, objects and methods to thinking about the user’s experience.

Being able to code while simultaneously keep in mind a user’s experience is vital to having an application or product that not only meets a customer’s or client’s needs, but can make or break a company’s existence because of how essential the user experience is to the bottom line.

Over the course of working on my Flatiron labs and my first CLI project, I learned how many layers there are to building an application. Not only is it important to keep a user in mind in how the flow of your application is written, including the text used to communicate with the user, but it’s even more important from a development standpoint in how you access data and choose how to most efficiently run methods and programs.

n other words, writing clean code and designing the architecture of the program (configuring the environment, choosing the classes, creating the flow of the objects) is not enough… it’s important to step back and ask yourself why the code is written the way it is and if there may be a better way to write it so that it runs the fastest it possibly can so that you don’t lose your user’s attention and take away from their experience.

You know the saying, “the more you learn, the more you learn that there’s even more to learn.”? Well, that’s been my experience for most of my life and so it likely will continue to remain. Good thing my name means seeker of knowledge!
