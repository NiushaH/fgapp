# README

FGApp uses the Ruby on Rails framework, a SQLite3 database and a bunch of Ruby gems.

This app is a minimum viable product for the Flatiron School Rails Project requirement for the self-paced software engineering course.  See project-specs.md for requirement details.

A user can sign up and sign in via email or OmniAuth2 to create a dream request or fund another's dream.  Dreams have CRUD capability.  Users have aliases of "Dreamer" and "Funder".  ERB forms have been used.

There has been no use of Rails scaffolds in the making of this app.
